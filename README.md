# ClubsManagementSystem
This is a project for the "Freshman Project" course.
A website was created using HTML, CSS, and PHP, that connects to a MySQL database. The website is supposed to represent a clubs management system for a university.
The database tracks all the Clubs, the Users, the President fo each club, and the members of each club.
Each user can see the list of clubs, join clubs, or leave club.
When a user creates a club, they become the club president.
A club president can remove members of their club, but cannot create any other club.
The system admin is a superUser who has priveleges to perform any operation they want.
