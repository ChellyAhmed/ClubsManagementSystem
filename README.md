# ClubsManagementSystem
This is a project for the "Freshman Project" course.
A Console Application was created using C programming language. The application is supposed to represent a clubs management system for a university.
The app tracks all the Clubs, the Users, the President fo each club, and the members of each club.
Each user can see the list of clubs, join clubs, or leave club.
When a user creates a club, they become the club president.
A club president can remove members of their club, but cannot create any other club.
